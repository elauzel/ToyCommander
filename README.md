# ToyCommander

JAY - scene setup)

1)	finish Scene 01: game menu (controls, instructions menus)

2)	make Scene 02: level select (some sort of image or rotating model of the single level - we can add more later) - this should happen whenever someone hits Free Play

3)	make Scene 03: character select (start with 3 models without moving parts at first - we can add more later) - this should happen whenever someone hits Free Play or Multiplayer

I don't remember if Scene 02 or Scene 03 comes first in the actual Toy Commander - let me know which and I'll re-order them if necessary. You should get the gist of what I'm getting at though.



AARON & JEREMY - coding and testing)

1)	put move script on 3 other models

2)	find and place models for obstacles and items

3)	implement item mechanics (powerups, ammunition, start simple)

4)	implement shooting mechanics, likely with raycasting and a projectile object (unlimited ammo at first)

5)	implement health mechanics and gui overlays for health bars

6)	implement death and respawn mechanics for each level

7) continue working on network code

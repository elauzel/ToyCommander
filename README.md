--- MUI IMPORTANTE

*1) Taking AmmoBox powerup without firing any shots throws an error and prevents re-instantiation

*2) Team score fixing

*3) Halos over network

--- UI and SFX

1) Ammo bar and values on UI dont reset upon respawn until first shot is fired in new life.

2) Add SFX to powerups

3) Reload sound gets looped until more ammo is gotten

4) UI needs to update Ammo amount after death rather than after the first shot

5) Reload sound doesnt play when the 32 clip runs out but it does when the ammo count is 0/0

--- Vehicles

1) Add a missile weapon with sound effect

2) Add tracer bullets to machine gun - bullet prefab needs instantiation and refinement

3) Tank still pulls to the right when moving forward

4) Auto-Upright script for Vehicles

--- Environment

1) Fix Fireplace Mantle, Solo Cup PREFAB, Bookcase

2) Put paintings in Kitchen and Living Room

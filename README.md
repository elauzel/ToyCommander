JEREMY)	make Scene 02: level select (some sort of image or rotating model of the single level - we can add more later)

find at least two other vehicle models for the character select, and apply movement/character controllers to them

AARON)	Push Scene 03

-> Jeremy will then MERGE Scene 03 with Textures & Models branch after Aaron pushes it

pull Scene 03 and then integrate resources (models, textures, etc) with Scene 03: apartment level

JAY)	making Scene 00: splash screen (names, title, press 'enter' to play, some sort of image/bg)
